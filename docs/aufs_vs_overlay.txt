    Introduction
+-----------------------------+
    Let's face it; 
    The original Linux Live Kit (and even some older 
    releases of Live Kit Improved) only supports AUFS... 
    And since you would need to recompile the kernel by yourself, the
    process from installing your favorite distro to having your own
    Live Kit Improved distro will be INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING for
    the average Joe's (and Jane's) and novices.

  Advanced multi-layered 
  Unification Filesystem
+-----------------------------+
   The Advanced multi-layered Unification Filesystem
   or "aufs"i s a filesystem that was created; to replace the "old-school"
   UnionFS (aka "unionfs"), that was used in the old-school
   versions of the original Linux Live Kit. It was unstable, and finally
   replaced by AUFS for the newer versions of Linux Live Kit (and even
   Live Kit Improved). The most popular Linux systems that's powered by
   Linux Live Kit (not Improved) is both Slax and Porteus; a Slackware
   based Linux Distro.

   But since then, the author of AUFS was struggling to get AUFS
   to the kernel mainline, but it was rejected because the code was
   too complex and uncommented.
   Instead of getting the space, the space was tooken instead by OverlayFS [3]
   After a lot of rejected requests, the author unfortunately gave up...

   After this, those who want to use AUFS is forced to get a compatible Linux
   distro (psst; It's Debian Jessie), or compile a custom kernel by patching
   the code for the filesystems. (in {KERNEL}/fs)
+-----------------------------+
    [3]
    Overlay Filesystem
+-----------------------------+
    OverlayFS ("overlayfs/overlay") is another unification 
    filesystem supposed to replace UnionFS.
    It was merged into kernel mainline instead of AUFS.

    OverlayFS is the future of Live Distros and Live Kit Improved however,
    there is a FATAL problem;
    OverlayFS doesn't support adding / removing branches on-the-fly! ):
    And that feature is only available to AUFS, since you know;
    Advanced multi-layered Filesystem; can re-stack all branches, even stack
    new ones (and/or remove old ones) on the fly! And that will make the
    transition really hard! (but not cruel enough!)

    Outroduction
+-----------------------------+
    If you want full compatibility with most of the Linux distros
    (and the mainline kernel itself) out-of-the-box;
    go with OverlayFS.

    If you want to just use it, and you love tinkering with the Linux kernel;
    go with AUFS.

    The Pro's and Con's:
    AUFS:
        PRO> Can add / remove branches on-the-fly.
        PRO> Easy to use.
        CON> Not compatible with most Linux distros out-of-the-box
        CON> Needs tinkering with the kernel source code, which might be
             frustrating to the most of the people.

    OverlayFS:
        PRO> Compatible with most (or even in some cases, all) of the Linux
             distros out-of-the-box.
        PRO> Doesn't need the same amount of kernel tinkerning as much as
             AUFS needs.
        CON> Not that simple to use as AUFS.
        CON> Doesn't support branch addition/removal on-the-fly.
