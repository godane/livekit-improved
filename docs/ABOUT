About Linux Live Kit Improved
===========================================================
Linux Live Kit Improved, as the name suggests, is an 
improved fork of the original Linux Live Kit.
Website (the original version): http://linux-live.org/

This text file combines all documents into one.
===========================================================

1] Boot parameters
===========================================================

These are used by the kernel and the Live Kit 
system itself.

You can pass these boot parameters to the bootloader:

Live Kit parameters:
 >  debug      - Start the Live Kit in verbose mode.
 >  dbg_shell  - Start the debug shell several times while starting up.
 >  from={n}   - Load data from {n}. (will search all devices for the data)
 >  copy2ram   - Boot the Live Kit system just as normal, but also copy data to RAM.
 >  perch      - Activate persistent changes.

Kernel parameters:
 >  noapic     - Disable APIC (if you want, or maybe if your kernel screams about it!)
 >  acpi=off   - Disable ACPI (if you might be still using a legacy system :P)
 >  init={n}   - Execute command {n} instead of the init script itself.

2] Bundles
===========================================================

A bundle is compressed squashfs filesystem, consisting of 
up-to-the-root directory structure. The older, but still 
functional predecessor of the bundle is called a 'module'. 
The bundle is an improved version of the 'module'.

NOTE:
  The defaults is 512k, but I opted with 1024k, since 
  my system can handle that load, and I will get a smaller 
  bundule size, which is a !!HUGE!! advantage!
  And, note: this message is also from the future (2k17!), which means
  that software has also evolved as the years has passed...
  'mksquashfs' will go nuts if you supply it with '-bs' instead of '-b'...

How to make a bundle:
    # mksquashfs bundle_rootfs wholefs.{bext} -comp xz -b 1024k

    or
    # mksquashfs /usr /usr.{bext} --keep-as-directory -comp xz -b 1024k

    or use function in livekitlib:
    # source ./livekitlib; mkbund bundle_rootfs wholefs.{bext}

3] Supported filesystems
===========================================================

The Live distro created by Linux Live Kit can be installed
on the following filesystems:

+ ISO9660 (CD)      -  using ISOLinux
+ FAT32   (vfat)    -  using SysLinux or EXTLinux
+ NTFS              -  using SysLinux or EXTLinux
+ EXT2/3/4, BTRFS   -  using EXTLinux
+ any other FS      -  using LILO

Most users will install on FAT32 for 
compatibility with any other operating systems.

4] Terminology
=========================================================

+ This toolkit is based on 
  the original Linux Live Kit. (http://linux-live.org/)

Extracted from the original terminology.txt:
> also known as Linux Live Kit. Formely known as Linux Live CD. Nowadays,
>  people mostly use USB flash drives, cameras, and other devices to run
>  such 'Live' linuxes, thus Live CD is no longer ideal name for it.

> Meaning of Kit is like a tool, toolkit, or such. Which (I believe) corresponds
> with the usage of such Live Linux distribution much better.
