# This is a config file for Linux Live Kit build script.
# You shouldn't need to change anything expect LIVEKITNAME
# Modified, used by Linux Live Kit Improved.

# Live Kit Name. Defaults to 'linux';
# This will be the name of the directory created on your CD/USB, which
# will contain everything including boot files and such.
# For example, Slax changes it to 'slax'
# Must not contain any spaces.
# If you change it, you must run ./tools/isolinux.bin-update script
# in order to update isolinux.bin for CD booting.
# If you don't need to boot from CD (eg you're only booting from USB)
# then just skip recompiling isolinux.bin, 
# tweak all setings, and you're done.

# The unification filesystem you want to use.
# This variable will be used by 'build' to replace
# both livekitlib and init to be COMPATIBLE with the
# filesystem of your choice.
# Check out docs/aufs_vs_overlayfs.txt to learn more...
# Supported keywords: [ aufs || AUFS, overlay || overlayfs || OverlayFS ]
# 'build' will automatically exit if your choice is
# not supported.
UNIFS="aufs"

# Kernel file, will be copied to your Live Kit
# Your kernel must support aufs (or overlayfs) and squashfs. 
# Debian Jessie's kernel has both AUFS (not OverlayFS) and SquashFS
# support out of the box.
